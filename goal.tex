\label{sec: Goal and Objectives}
\par In this work, we propose an investigation into self-supervised image denoising frameworks that overcomes \cite{lehtinen2018noise2noise} the limitations above. Our approach consists of a training image pairs generation strategy based on sub-sampling and a self-supervised training scheme with a regularization term. Specifically, training input and target are generated by random neighbor sub-samplers, where two sub-sampled paired images are extracted from a single corrupted image with each element on the same position of the two images being neighbors in the original corrupted image. In this way, if we assume that noise with each pixel is independent conditioned on its pixel value and there is no correlation between noise in different positions, then these two sub-sampled paired corrupted images are independent given the ground-truth of the original corrupted image. Accordingly, inspired by Noise2Noise \cite{lehtinen2018noise2noise}, we use the above training pairs to train a denoising network. Besides, we develop a regularization term to address the essential difference of pixel ground-truth values between neighbors on the original corrupted image. The proposed self-supervised framework aims at training denoising networks with only single images available, without any modifications to the network structure. Any network that performs well in supervised image denoising tasks can be used in our framework. Moreover, our method does not depend on any noise models either.
\par We evaluate our proposed approaches to improve over existing frameworks, a series of experiments on both synthetic corrupted images are conducted. The extensive experiments show that our Neighbor2Neighbor outperforms traditional denoisers and existing self-supervised denoising methods learned from only single corrupted images. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method.
\par The main contributions of our paper are as follows:

\begin{itemize}
    \item We propose a novel self-supervised framework for image denoising, in which any existing denoising networks can be trained without any clean targets, network modifications, or noise model assumptions.
    \item From the theoretical perspective, we provide a sound motivation for the proposed framework.
    \item Our method performs very favorably against state-of-the-art self-supervised denoising methods especially on real-world datasets, which shows its potential applications in real-world scenarios.
\end{itemize}
